# Kafka_twitter_Analysis
# I intend to use this Twitter feed to get real time data streams into an application that will put into Kafka.This data will end up in ElasticSearch at the end and this is just for POC purpose.

This code is used to send the real time data to Kafka producer through Twitter API and later we consumed data .
